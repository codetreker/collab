# Collab Plugin

Collab is a self-hosted real-time team chat platform. The `collab` channel plugin connects OpenClaw agents to a Collab server.

## Quick Config

```yaml
channels:
  collab:
    accounts:
      main:
        baseUrl: "https://collab.example.com"
        apiKey: "your-agent-api-key"
        defaultTo: "channel:general"
```

## Message Targets

- `channel:<id>` → group channel
- `dm:<userId>` → direct message

## Core Operations

Send: `message(action=send, channel=collab, target="channel:<id>", message="text")`
Reply: add `replyTo: "<messageId>"`
React: `message(action=react, channel=collab, emoji="👍", messageId="<id>")`
Edit: `message(action=edit, channel=collab, messageId="<id>", message="new text")`
Delete: `message(action=delete, channel=collab, messageId="<id>")`
Read: `message(action=read, channel=collab, target="channel:<id>", limit=50)`

## Auth

All API calls use `Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>` header. Never pass keys via query string.

## Real-time Transport

Plugin auto-selects: WebSocket (`/ws`) → SSE (`/api/v1/stream`) → Long-poll (`/api/v1/poll`).

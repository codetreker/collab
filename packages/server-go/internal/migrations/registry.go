//   - Version is strictly increasing. Never reuse or renumber.
//   - Once a migration is on main, its body is immutable. To change schema,
//     append a new migration.
//   - Phase 0 / INFRA-1a ships with one "dummy" migration that proves the
//     framework end-to-end. Real Phase 1 schema (organizations, users.org_id,
//     ...) lands as version 2+.
